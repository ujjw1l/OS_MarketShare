# OS_MarketShare
This project visualizes the market share trends of operating systems from 2009 to 2025 using a bar chart race. It highlights the rise and fall of platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows over time.

Project Title:
Operating System Market Share Analysis (2009–2025)

Project Description:
This project analyzes the global market share trends of various operating systems—both mobile and desktop—from 2009 to 2025. It uses historical data to visualize how different OS platforms such as Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Symbian, and others have evolved in popularity over time.

The project employs Python for data processing and visualization, primarily using the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting. The core highlight is the use of the bar_chart_race library to create an animated horizontal bar chart that dynamically shows the changes in OS rankings year by year.

Bar Chart Race Animation
A bar chart race is an animated visualization where bars move, grow, and shrink over time, reflecting how the market shares of different operating systems have changed. It effectively communicates trends, transitions, and competition between platforms in a visually compelling way.

Video Generation with FFmpeg
The animation is rendered into a high-quality .mp4 video using the bar_chart_race library, which internally utilizes ffmpeg, a powerful open-source multimedia framework. FFmpeg encodes the animation frames into a smooth, shareable video file.

Outcome
The final result is a data-driven video that captures the evolution of operating system market shares from 2009 to 2025, offering clear insights into the rise and fall of major platforms. This project is useful for understanding historical tech trends, consumer preferences, and the competitive landscape of operating systems over time.
